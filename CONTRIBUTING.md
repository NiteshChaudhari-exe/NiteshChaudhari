# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few simple guidelines:

- Fork the repository and open a branch for your change: `git checkout -b my-feature`
- Keep changes small and focused. One feature/fix per PR.
- If the change affects the UI, include screenshots or a short recording.
- Run the project locally and make sure `npm run build` and `npm run lint` pass.
- Write clear commit messages and a descriptive PR title and description.

Pull requests will be reviewed; maintainers may request changes before merging.

If you'd like to propose a large change, open an issue first to discuss design and scope.
